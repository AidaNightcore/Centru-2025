## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The website is intended to be used during lessons or self-study sessions, where learners can follow along with the teacher, inspect the code, and experiment with the examples in real time and can compare their files and understand if and where they made any mistakes.

If you want to learn or clarify concepts with games, use these websites:

- CSS: [Grid](https://cssgridgarden.com/), [Flex](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

- JS [WarriorJs](https://warriorjs.com/)

- General [FrontendMentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges)

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

You only need a web browser. For a better development workflow, a simple static server or an editor extension that serves files is recommended.

VS Code with Live Server extension is the fastest and easiest way.

```
code --install-extension ritwickdey.liveserver
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AidaNightcore/Centru-2025.git
cd <Centru-2025>
```

2. Open the project folder in VS Code.

```
code .
```

3. Open index.html in the browser

- In VS Code: Right click on the .html file, select 'Open with Live Server'

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

This repository is updated after every lesson. Each commit represents the state of the website at the end of a specific session. It uses a [wireframe design](https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/503981014567539413/) to make the explanations more visual and easier for separation of the webpage in divs, sections etc.

### How to use the repository

You can use the project in two main ways:

#### 1. Follow the development progress

- Open the **Commits** section on GitHub.
- Each commit shows what was added, changed, or removed during that lesson.
- You can click any commit to view or download the exact code from that stage.

#### 2. Use the code as a write-along template

If you want to practice by writing the code yourself follow the [getting started](#-getting-started) steps to clone and have a local copy.

After each class, the repository receives new updates. To stay current either redownload or:

```
git pull
```
